Vertical scaling: Buy better machines
Load balancing not required
Single point of failure
Inter process communication
Data consistent
Hardware limit
Small no. of users

Horizontal scaling: Buy more machines
Load balancing required
Resilient
Network call(RPC)
Data inconsistency
No hardware limit
Huge number of users

Load balancing: The process of balancing the load evenly on all servers

Consistent Hashing

Application layer protocol:
1. Client-server protocol
Client: Sends Request
Server: Receives request, process request, send response

Unidirectional communication
HTTP - 1 connection
FTP - 2 connection, control(always on) and data(can be on or off)
SMTP - sending the email IMAP

Bi-directional communication
Web socket

2. Peer to peer protocol
Bi-directional communication + client-to-client
WebRTC
