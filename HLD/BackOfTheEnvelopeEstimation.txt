BOE Estimation

 - Don't directly jump to design part
 - Drives our decision for System Design

Considerations:
 - Rough(tshirt size) Estimation
 - Don't spend much time
 - Keep the assumption value simple(multiple of 10 or 100)

What to answer
 - No. of servers?
 - RAM?
 - Storage?
 - Tradeoffs(CAP)

Estimation of Facebook

1. Traffic Estimation:

Total users: 1 billion
DAU(Daily Active users): 25% of total users = 250 Million

Every user(DAU): 5 Read / 2 Write = 7 queries per day
250 Million users -> 250 Million * 7 queries per day = 1750 Million = 1.75 billion queries per day
Queries per second = 1750/(60*24*24) = 18K queries per second 

2. Storage assumption:
 - Every user(DAU) doing 2 post(each post -> 250 characters)
 - 10% of users upload 1 image(300 KB size)

 1 Post -> 250 characters, 1 character = 2 bytes, 1 post -> 500 bytes
 2 Post -> 1 KB
 250 Million users * 1 KB = 250 GB/day

 10%of DAU -> 25 Million
 For images 25 Million * 300 KB = 7500GB = 7.5 TB/day

Let's say we want to store for 5 years(around 2000 days)

(POST) 2000 * 250 GB = 500 TB
(IMAGES) 2000 * 7.5TB = 15 PB

3. RAM estimation:
For each user, last 5 posts are in cache
1 post = 500 bytes, 5 posts = 2500 bytes

250 Million -> 2.5KB * 250 Million = 2.5 * 2.5 * 10^3 * 10^8 = 6.25 * 10^11 = 625 GB
1 Machine = 62 GB, then 10 machines are required for caching

Latency: 
95% time -> 500ms(1 request)

18K req. per second 
1 Server -> 50 threads => 100 request per second
No. of machines = 18k/100 = 180 servers

Tradeoffs:
CAP theorem
Keep A and P, drop C
