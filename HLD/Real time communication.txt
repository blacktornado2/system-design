Capacity Estimation:
Daily Active users(DAU): 1 Billion
Each user sends how many message daily: 100
Average size of a message: 0.1KB
No. of messages: 100 Billion
Data send: 100 * 10^9 * 100 = 10 ^ 13 bytes => 10 TB per day
Per year = 10 * 400 => 4000 TB => 4 PB / year

Per user per day Images/Videos/GIF's => 10 Billion
average size => 1 MB
Total data = 10000TB => 10PB/day
Per year => 400 * 10 => 4000PB => 4 Exabyte
