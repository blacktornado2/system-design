SQL and NoSQL

SQL(Structured Query Language)
- manage RDBMS
- RDBMS has rows and columns
- Relations b/w multiple tables


Structure
- Tables, rows, columns
- Pre-determined schema
- Relations b/w different tables

Nature
- Concentrated/Centralized(data should be on the same server)
- 

Scale
- Very well vertical scaling

Properties
- ACID Properties

A - Atomicity
C - Consistency
I - Isolation
D - Durability

NoSQL(Not only SQL)

Structure
NoSQL works on unstructured data
Ex: Key-value DB, document DB, column-wise DB, Graph DB

Key-Value DB: ex: DynamoDB
document DB: we can query on key and also on value, ex: MongoDB
column-wise DB: 


Graph DB: data is stored in the form of Node and edge
social networking
recommendation engine




Nature: distributed




Scale: It supports Horizontal scaling very well



Properties: 
BASE Properties
BA -> Basically Available
S -> Save state
E -> Eventual Consistency



SQL                                                         NoSQL
Flexible Query functionality                            Doesn't support flexible query functionality
Data is relational in Nature                                                                                    
Data Integrity: ACID                                    Doesn't follow ACID, 
Ex: Financial institutions
dafwf                                                   High availability, high performance with some inconsistency
